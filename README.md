# RAS-547 Robotic Systems 1 Project: Solving a 4x4 Maze with MyCobot Pro 600ü§ñ 
 This project aimed to tackle the challenge of solving 4x4 rectangular mazes autonomously using the MyCobot Pro 600 robotic arm. 
 A maze was generated, printed on a plastic board, and placed within the AI Kit's camera zone. 
 The solution algorithm used an image of the maze to identify the entrance, solution path, and exit, translating the maze into real-world waypoints for the robot to navigate.
 To ensure accuracy and efficiency, we created a Digital Twin of the robot, which enabled us to simulate and validate the solution path using forward and inverse kinematics before deploying it in real-world execution. 
 The robot was programmed to autonomously follow the solution path, navigating straight-line sections to reach the exit, with seamless alignment between simulation and physical performance. ü§ñ‚û°Ô∏èüèÅ
